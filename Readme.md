# Lazy Placing

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazy-placing)

A Minecraft ~1.20.1 Forge & Fabric mod which changes one of the main mechanics in game - block placement timing.

In vanilla Minecraft, any block will be placed instantly, but now you'll have to wait a bit before a block will be placed.

## Info

By default, the time needed to place a block will be 0.6 seconds (see [configuration](#Configuration) section).

The mod...

* works in singleplayer, LAN and dedicated server
* it should be compatible with most of the other mods, it should work with all block-items, which do not have custom block placement mechanics
* affects only survival gamemode

## Dependencies

This mod requires:
* [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/ru-ru/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc) ~1.20.1
* [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) ^0.16.9
* [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) ^0.92.2

(Version resolution from [Fabric Documentation](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/documentation:fabric_mod_json_spec#versionrange))

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the mod, just remove it from the `mods` folder.

## Configuration

When the game starts for the first time, the mod will generate a configuration file in `config/lazyplacing.json` (in root folder of Minecraft, not `mods` folder).

The file will have the following content:

```json
{
  "stablePlacingDuration": 12,
  "maxRandomAdditionDuration": 0
}
```

You can create this file by hand if you want to change the default without starting the game.

If the configuration file was deleted, mod will generate a new one with default values.

### Properties:
* `stablePlacingDuration` - default value is `12` ticks (0.6 seconds). The minimum time needed to place a block
* `maxRandomAdditionDuration` - default value is `0` ticks (0 seconds). The maximum clamp for random time, which may to the `stablePlacingDuration`
